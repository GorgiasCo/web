                                          2. Membership.&nbsp;</span>

                                        <br/><br/>Your Gorgias membership will continue month-to-month until terminated. Unless you cancel your membership before your monthly renewal date, you authorize us to charge your next month's membership fee to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below). To use the Gorgias service you must have Internet access, and you must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment, which you may update from time to time ("Payment Method"). You can find specific details regarding your membership with Gorgias by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link available at the top of the pages of the Gorgias website under your profile name.
                                        Free Contents
                                        <br/><br/>2.1. Your Gorgias membership may start with free contents. The free contents period of your membership lasts for one month, or as otherwise specified during sign-up and is intended to allow new members and certain former members to try the service. You will be notified during sign-up whether you are eligible for a free trial.
                                        2.2. &nbsp; We will bill your Payment Method for your monthly membership fee at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel your membership prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the monthly membership price and end date of your free trial period, visit our website and click the "Billing details" link on the "Your Account" page. You will not receive a notice from us that your paid membership has begun.

                                          3. Billing</span>

                                        <br/><br/>3.1. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for our service will be billed on a monthly basis to your Payment Method on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paid membership. In some cases the timing of your billing may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit our website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Your Account" page to see your next payment date.
                                        <br/><br/>3.2. Payment Methods. You can change your Payment Method by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not change your Payment Method or cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have obtained a valid Payment Method. You authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
                                        <br/><br/>3.3. Cancellation. You can cancel your Gorgias membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Gorgias service through the end of your monthly billing period. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods. To cancel, go to the "Your Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Your Account" page. If you signed up for Gorgias using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Gorgias membership at any time, including during your free trial, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from, the Gorgias service through that third party. You may also find billing information about your Gorgias membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
                                        <br/><br/>3.4. Changes to the Price and Service Plans. We may change our service plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to our service plans will apply to you no earlier than 30 days following email notice to you.
